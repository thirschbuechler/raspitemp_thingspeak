# raspitemp_thingspeak
my hacked way to get temperature measurements from a Raspberrypi to Thingspeak to a Webgui via Python.

I will upload my scripts and do my best to explain the basics, but at the end of the day this will remain a hack and be anything but a full-fledged product. It is almost literally held together by duct-tape, but it works. Most of the time.
I'll try to provide a demo of the webinterface, as well.

However, i didn't come up with all of this, so i'll try to properly link every project i used stuff from. Many thanks to those guys, should they ever read these lines;)

Used hardware: a Raspberry B+ (though you don't need the extra pins for this), many cheap ds18b20 temperature sensors and one DHT22 t+humidity sensor.
